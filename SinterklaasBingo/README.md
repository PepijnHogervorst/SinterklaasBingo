# SinterklaasBingo
Processing build Bingo application for the dutch tradition Sinterklaas. Processing is used because of the easy 2 screen setup. Idea is to make it a windows UWP app one day. 

## Easy setup:
To use this application you will need Processing version 3 or higher. [Link here!](https://processing.org/download/)

When installed correctly open the SinterklaasBingo.pde and if needed edit the 2 variables to your needs:
* bingoHighestNumber: determine size of bingo game, default on 90.  
* historySize: the size of previous bingo numbers shown on both screens. Limited to 5! Otherwise font size gets to small or even smaller than zero!
